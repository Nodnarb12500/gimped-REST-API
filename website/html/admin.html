    <!--
        Lets Break up what needs to be done in small sections. Even though i get carried away with small sections.
        seeing a big section still makes me pause and just not want to do it
        TODO:
            - Logging in as admin
                - assume the user logging in is admin
                - ask for password in a box
                - send the login information to the server (use fetch())
                - store the token in localstorage OR as a cookie[pref]
            - After admin is logged in
                - send more post requests to obtain the data we wish to display
                    - userAccounts (unsafe) - Not doing
                    - userData 
                        - this should be fine, 
                        - in most cases this data should already be public.
                            - assuming we arent storing secrets
                    - tokens.js? (extra unsafe) - Not doing
            - I would like user password resets but thats not something I think I can do securely
