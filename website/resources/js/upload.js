/**
 * This file should take the form data and the files and upload both sets of data to the server though 2 different post requests
 * TODO:
 *  - Create a function to send data to the server via a POST request [Using fetch()]
 *  - attempt to display the data sent from the server on the screen somewhere 
 *      - this could be useful for failed signups/logins in the future
 *  - once sending and receiving data is working, create the form for both upload types
 *      - both of these API calls should happen at the same time. (one can fail because of the API limits)
 *      - Downloads should be directed into their own folder and filepaths should be generated on the server
