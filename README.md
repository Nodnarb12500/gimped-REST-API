# gimped-REST-API
This is a template ive been working on for a while. its not really a REST API because its made to be useable with only a browser.

I have just realized I might be adding to much stuff to this template. My next project might be influencing what I add to this more then I thought it might.
If I end up remove large sections of this program its because it became to big, and my projects required me to remove sections of this template.

# Progress

Progress might slow done on some of the more "fun" ideas i have for this template. if for some reason it wasnt clear this is a template i use for meny projects ive so far made atleast 5 nodeJS projects using older versions of this template. once i get this to a decent level of working ill attempt to remake some of those projects in some forks. the reason why i bring this up is my current work flow is catered to my next project so some of the pushes might be overly biased to that project and will make some of the features i want to add harder to test such as pagination. or sorting on the database. with the current data im testing with theres no way i can use multipul search terms.
