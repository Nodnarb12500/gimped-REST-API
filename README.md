# gimped-REST-API
This is a template ive been working on for a while. its not really a REST API because its made to be useable with only a browser.

I have just realized I might be adding to much stuff to this template. My next project might be influencing what I add to this more then I thought it might.
If I end up remove large sections of this program its because it became to big, and my projects required me to remove sections of this template.
